## Description (4000 chars max)

```
Restock is a straightforward tool for small retailers to track and reorder inventory. Made for shop owners, convenience stores, and independent retailers who want to skip spreadsheets, notes, and long email threads.

HOW IT WORKS

1. WALK — Go through your store and check what needs restocking.
2. LOG — Take a photo of your inventory sheet or clipboard. Restock reads the photo and pulls out product names and quantities automatically.
3. SEND — Items are grouped by supplier. Tap to send reorder emails directly from the app.

KEY FEATURES

• Offline-First — All your data stays on your device. No cloud sync. No account required. What you scan and manage stays on your phone.

• Smart Image Parsing — Take a photo of any handwritten or printed inventory list. Restock uses AI to read and extract the products and quantities for you.

• Supplier Grouping — Products are automatically sorted by supplier, so each vendor gets their own order in one tap.

• Professional Reorder Emails — Restock sends clean, well-formatted emails with your order details in a table. Emails are sent on your behalf from Restock, but when suppliers reply, the response comes directly to your email inbox.

• Session Management — Keep track of past restocking sessions. Review what you ordered, when you ordered it, and pick up where you left off on incomplete sessions.

• Connect with Your Team — Have a store with multiple branches? Create a company in Restock and invite managers from other locations to join. Everyone shares the same supplier list, and team members can view the latest restocking sessions from other branches (read-only). Useful for keeping visibility across locations without duplicating work.

• Minimal Setup — No passwords, no verification emails, no waiting. Enter your name and store once to get started.

HOW EMAILS WORK

When you send an order, the email arrives in your supplier's inbox like this:

  From: Restock App <noreply@restockapp.email>
  Subject: Restock Order from [Your Store Name]

The email contains a table with product names, quantities, and your store details. When the supplier hits reply, their response goes straight to your personal email—not to Restock. You handle the conversation directly with your supplier from there.

ABOUT AI

Restock uses AI to read text from your inventory photos. The image is sent to a secure cloud service for processing, then deleted. Your photos are not stored or used for any other purpose.

PRIVACY

Your data stays on your device unless you choose to send an email or join a team. Restock does not track your activity or collect your inventory data.

Download Restock and simplify your restocking routine.
